# Traffic Light Detection Application

This project is a traffic light detection application that uses **YOLOv5** for object detection and **OpenCV** for color detection. The application is built using Python and Streamlit for the user interface. It detects traffic lights in an image and identifies their current state (red, yellow, or green).

## Features

- **Traffic Light Detection**: Detects traffic lights in uploaded images using YOLOv5.
- **Color Detection**: Identifies the color of the detected traffic light (red, yellow, or green).
- **Streamlit Interface**: Simple and interactive web interface for uploading images and viewing results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-light-detection.git
   cd traffic-light-detection

## Run the Streamlit application
